# HitBall
Android videogame build with Unity Engine in C#. 
It was uploaded to Google Playstore on 04.08.2020 and remained there until 28.11.2023. 
It was removed from the store due to issues related to the old Unity Ads system. 

# Game
The game consists on a platform that can be controlled through a slider, similar to a classic Atari game, Pong, However the platform would slide in a circular track. 
The goal is not let the ball escape the area of the screen.
It is very easy and intuitive to play.

# Important Note
All variables, functions, files, etc, were originally written with portuguese names. These were translated to english here to ease readability.
